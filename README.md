# protoabm

Example of deploying [mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/master/) as a containerised app service. 

To get the latest image: 
```bash
$ docker pull docker pull virgesmith/protoabm:latest
```

Uses mesa's `wolf_sheep` example, and the code also contains a modified version of the Conway's game of life example.
